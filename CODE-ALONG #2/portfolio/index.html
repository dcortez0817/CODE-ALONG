                <h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a 4th year student at Midwestern State University expecting to
                    graduate in May 2019 with a degree in computer science. I first 
                    discovered my love for computer science as a high school junior. 
                    Any ordinary programmer will tell you how captivating it was to see 
                    "Hello World" display to the screen after his or her first program, 
                    but it's the problem-solving aspect of coding that truly got me hooked.

                    I enjoy leadership opportunities, but am not afraid to step back when 
                    it's needed. There is something about gaining the trust and support 
                    from others that motivates me. I also possess a very attention to detail 
                    characteristic that drives me to work on projects until I feel they are 
                    done to a tee of what is expected.

                <p>
                    When I am not sitting behind a computer I enjoy spending time with 
                    friends, long-boarding, playing sports, or doing something else active.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This program provided me with financial aid and an enormous amount of 
                    support from faculty and students. The 3.0 GPA requirement, casual meetings,
                    and occasional tutoring hours gave me an extra incentive to excel throughout  
                    my college career.
