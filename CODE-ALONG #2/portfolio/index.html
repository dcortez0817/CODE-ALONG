                <h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
                <p>
                    I am an <strong>energetic</strong>, <strong>optimistic</strong>, <strong>adaptable</strong>, 
                    and <strong>hard-working </strong>individual whom is never shy to ask for help or add 
                    valuable input.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I received my Bachelor's of Science degree in computer science from Midwestern 
                    State University in <strong>May 2019</strong>. I first discovered my <em>love</em> 
                    for computer science as a high school junior. Any ordinary programmer will tell you 
                    how captivating it was to see <code style="background-color: rgb(240, 234, 234)">
                    Hello World</code> display to the screen after his or her first program, but it's the 
                    problem-solving aspect of coding that truly got me hooked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I enjoy being counted on under pressure and I tend to thrive in group projects 
                    or other situations involving teamwork. There is something about gaining the  
                    trust and support from others that motivates me. I possess a very attention  
                    to detail mindset that drives me to work on projects until I feel they are 
                    done to a tee of what is expected, and it is typically easy for me to adapt my coding 
                    tendencies to those I work alongside.

                <h2><em>Hobbies</em></h2>
                <p>
                    When I am not sitting behind a computer I enjoy spending time with 
                    friends, long-boarding, playing sports, or doing something else active.

                    This program provided me with financial aid and an enormous amount of 
                    support from faculty and students. The 3.0 GPA requirement, casual meetings,
                    and occasional tutoring hours gave me an extra incentive to excel throughout  
                    my college career.
