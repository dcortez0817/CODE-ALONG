                        <p>
                            It all started in the summer of 2005. As twenty year old college student Douglas Zetroc moseyed around the big city of Dallas
                            with some friends in search of a hangout spot, it occurred to him that there weren't many restaurants that were suitable for
                            multiple parts of the day. He had this big idea to open a restaurant to offer a multipurpose menu and environment, but did not
                            have any idea where to begin. So he turned to his childhood buddies and his parents to make his dream a reality, and a year later
                            arose the great spot known as Zetroc's!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Named after it's founder, Douglas Zetroc, Zetroc's presents itself as an old fashioned diner by day and a social spot by night!
                            Making it fitting for all ages or functions. Whether it be a lunch break, brunch date, or dinner event &ndash; Zetroc's is your spot! 
                            From our <em>American Classic </em> burger to our <em>All-Time Favorite</em> Italian Sausage and Peppers dish, our menu offers a variety 
                            of rich-in-flavor meals that will surely satisfy your taste buds. Even our house salad has some swagger to it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Zetroc envisioned a place created by the people it welcomed. Our restaurant is whatever our customers make of it. It could be the place
                            you had your first date, the place you meet up with your friends everyday on your lunch break, or the place you stumble into at night
                            while moseying around the city with some friends. Zetroc's small town feel gives customers an out from the hectic energy of the big city
                            of Dallas.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Hope to see you soon!
                        </p>
